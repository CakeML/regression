  - Colour stopped jobs by success/failure
  - Show time of last output (or time since last update) for running jobs?

TODO: Make server stop jobs that have been running too long

TODO: Consider using AJAX or whatever to refresh the html interface dynamically?

TODO: Replace calls to the OS shell with SML Basis functionality
  In worker.sml there is a call to OS.Process.system that passes quite a lot of
  work off to the shell: setting environment variables, executing a subprocess,
  and redirecting standard streams. This could all be implemented in the SML
  Basis, in particular using Posix structure, instead. Doing so might be more
  reliable?
